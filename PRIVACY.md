# Privacy Policy for Melody

**Last Updated:** January 7, 2026

## 1. Introduction
We value your privacy. This policy explains what data **Melody** ("the Bot") handles and how it is used.

## 2. Data We Collect
Melody is designed to be privacy-first.
- **We do NOT store** any user messages, voice data, or personal information in a database.
- **We do NOT** track your listening habits or build user profiles.
- **Ephemeral Data**: When you run a command (e.g., `/play`), the Bot temporarily processes the text of that specific command to execute the action. This data is discarded immediately after processing.

## 3. Data Storage
There is no persistent data storage for user activities. The Bot only holds "Queue" data in its temporary memory (RAM) while the music session is active. Once the bot restarts or the queue ends, all session data is wiped.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The Bot interacts with Discord, SoundCloud, and Spotify APIs to function.
- **Discord**: Handles your account authentication and command transport.
- **SoundCloud/Spotify**: Receives search queries to find music. They may collect data in accordance with their own independent privacy policies.

## 5. Contact
If you have concerns about your data, you may contact the developer via Discord.
